Todo:

graph:
Energy vs cores + spline (OK)
IS vs time for all cores (OK0)
Energy vs time for all cores (OK)

Tuesday 16.09:
1) All graphs for freq vs cores
2) Total Energy vs cores @ many freqs
3) Roofline, 1 core all freqs. -> C graphs.



Questions:
1) How does IPC change with various numnber of cores?? still 4?? weird. What formulae explain this?

BW line?

many rooflines per cores or one roofline per socket?
